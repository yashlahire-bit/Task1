# Task 1: Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## Overview
This repository contains my research on the CIA Triad, common threat actors, and attack surface mapping as part of the Elevate Labs Internship.

## Files Included
- **Theory_Task1.pdf**: Detailed research on security fundamentals.
- **scripts/**: Practical demonstrations of security concepts.

## Code Demonstrations

### 1. Integrity Check (`integrity_check.py`)
This script demonstrates the **Integrity** pillar of the CIA triad. It uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to detect if a message (like a bank transfer) has been tampered with by an attacker.

### 2. Attack Surface Map (`attack_mapping.json`)
A structured JSON file mapping common applications (Email, WhatsApp, Banking) to their potential attack surfaces and associated threats.

## How to Run
To run the integrity check, ensure you have Python installed and run:
`python scripts/integrity_check.py`
